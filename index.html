                <h3>About the Book</h3>
                <p class="text">The Hate U Give tells the story of Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black teen who lives in an underserved urban community and attends a wealthy suburban prep school. When she witnesses a police shooting that kills her unarmed friend, Starr must decide how much to speak out and to whom. This book addresses many important and complex topics, including friendship, community, identity, institutional racism, and police brutality. Some of the subject matter is sensitive, and the language includes slang, profanity, and references to violence, drugs, and sex.</p>
